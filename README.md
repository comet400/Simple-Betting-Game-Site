# Simple-Betting-Game-Site
this is a project made in html that generates betting and football matches for the player

How to use:
The HTML has every single logic already attached to it, the way to play should be very intuitive
the program displays all matches available and then the user may pick one.
once selected, the betting amount needs to be inserted.
the user now might win or lose after match simulation ends
